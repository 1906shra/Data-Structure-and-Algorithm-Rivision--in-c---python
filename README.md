Data Structure and Algorithm Revision (C++ & Python)

Welcome to the Data Structure Revision repository! This repo is designed to help you revise fundamental data structures, key concepts, algorithms, and practical implementations across various programming languages.


Arrays: Basic operations, searching, sorting, dynamic arrays.

Linked Lists: Singly, doubly, and circular linked lists, operations, and use cases.

Stacks: LIFO structure, stack operations, and applications.

Queues: FIFO structure, operations, circular queues, and priority queues.

Trees: Binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, heaps, tree traversals.

Graphs: Adjacency matrix, adjacency list, BFS, DFS, shortest path algorithms.

Heaps: Min-heaps, max-heaps, heap operations, and heap sort.

Hash Tables: Hashing techniques, collision resolution, and use cases.

Greedy Algorithms: Problem-solving approach, examples like interval scheduling, Huffman coding, and more.

Dynamic Programming (DP): Problem breakdown, memoization, tabulation, examples like knapsack, longest common subsequence, and more.
